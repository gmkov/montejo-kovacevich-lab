Uppsala offers an international and diverse environment, with nature and culture at our doorstep, as well as strong working and social benefits (see some employee benefits [here](https://www.uu.se/en/staff/employment/employee-benefits) + heavily subsidised childcare for >1 year olds). 
I particularly encourage students and researchers from underrepresented backgrounds to apply.

When contacting me please include your research interests and a CV.
