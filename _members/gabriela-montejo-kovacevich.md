I'm Gabriela/Gabi/Gabby, a researcher fascinated by the incredible diversity of life and how it evolves. My work focuses on understanding the genetic and environmental factors that shape adaptation, particularly in insects. I like diving into the complexity of data analysis, but also love being out in the field, observing our study systems and doing experiments. I'm driven by the desire to uncover how nature works, but I also enjoy the connections that science brings â€“ collaborations, mentorship, and the sharing of knowledge. When I'm not working, you can find me walking with my family, travelling, or eating good Spanish food.
